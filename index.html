                <p>Stretching across the Seine, Pont Alexandre III is an ornate arch bridge that connects Paris’ 7th and 8th arrondissements. In fact, more than half of the buildings you see in Paris today were built before 1949. Picturesque parks are scattered throughout each quarter, offering refuge from the urban bustle. The Jardin du Luxembourg (Luxembourg Gardens) covers 57 acres, and is known for its lawns, tree-lined promenades, and the impressive Medici Fountain. The octagonal Grand Bassin sits in the center of the garden—which is often used by children to sail model boats—and hundreds of statues are scattered throughout the park. Stroll through the hedge-lined paths on a nature walk, or relax on one of Luxembourg Gardens’ iconic green chairs. Outdoor music concerts are held throughout the year, though summer is the most eventful season.</p>
